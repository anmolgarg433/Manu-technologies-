Comparison of Methods
Two-Pointer Technique: Time Complexity 𝑂(𝑛), Space Complexity 𝑂(1). It's efficient and fast with a single pass through the list.
Count and Split: Time Complexity 𝑂(𝑛), but requires two passes. It's simple but less efficient than the two-pointer technique.
Recursive Split: Time Complexity 𝑂(𝑛), but potentially high space complexity due to recursion stack. Not suitable for very long lists.
Iterative with Array: Time Complexity 𝑂(𝑛), Space Complexity 𝑂(𝑛) due to storage in an array. Offers direct access to nodes but uses more memory.
Conclusion
The Two-Pointer Technique is generally the most efficient method for splitting a singly linked list, especially when considering both time and space complexities.
It's effective for most practical purposes due to its simplicity and efficiency. 
Other methods might be preferred in specific contexts, such as when additional features like random access are beneficial or when recursion simplifies the problem context despite its overhead.
